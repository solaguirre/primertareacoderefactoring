# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

The purpose of this project was refactor the existing code for a webpage and make it more accessible. 

## Semantic HTML Elements

The code was inspected, cleaned up and  formatted to make it easier to work with. The first changes made to the code were to take the existing <div> elements and changed them to appropriate HTML elements. Comments were included before each element where a change was made. 

## Navigation Tab

The 'Search Engine Optimization' link was not functioning like the other two links that take you to the designated section within the same page. 

## Images

Images were missing accessible alt attributes. Alt text added to specifically describe the images.

## CSS

In the CSS some of the selectors needed to be renamed to correspond with the HTML. There were many blocks of code that could be consolidated. The repetitive code was redundant and could be resolved by grouping the selectors that had the same values.
